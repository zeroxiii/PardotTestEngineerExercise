# PardotTestEngineerExcercise
## Candidate: Rahmaan Lodhia

Problem Statement: 

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to speak with me about the Software Engineer in Test role.  Iâ€™d like to move you on to the next step in the process where we have you complete a technical assessment by building a Selenium test suite in Java using Selenium WebDriver (please do not export from the IDE, this should be coded with Web Driver).  Please include all files necessary to run the project on github with a readme.md.  It shouldn't take too long to complete, and I've pasted the instructions below:

1. Log in to Pardot (https://pi.pardot.com, Username: pardot.applicant@pardot.com, Password: Applicant2012)
2. Create a list with a random name (Marketing > Segmentation > Lists)
3. Attempt to create another list with that same name and ensure the system correctly gives a validation failure
4. Rename the original list
5. Ensure the system allows the creation of another list with the original name now that the original list is renamed
6. Create a new prospect (Prospect > Prospect List)
7. Add your new prospect to the newly created list
8. Ensure the new prospect is successfully added to the list upon save
9. Send a text only email to the list (Marketing > Emails)  *Please note, email is disabled in this account so you will not actually be able to send the email.  This is okay.
10. Log out


## Instructions

1. Download either the entire repo.

2. On a computer running the latest version of Java (Note: this program was compiled using Java Version 1.8.0_71) and Mozilla FireFox installed, open up terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory housing the PardotTest.java and PardotTestRunner.java file.

3. Compile the program first with the following command:  
**javac PardotTest.java PardotTestRunner.java**

4. The PardotTest.class and PardotTestRunner.class will be created in the working directory, and you can now run the java program with the following command:  
**java PardotTestRunner**

## Notes

The WebDriver used in this implementation was with Mozilla FireFox as it does not require any additional setup on the users end.  This code will only work on a computer with FireFox installed.  

A timeout was implemented in this code to for about 10-15 seconds.  This was to accomodate slower internet connections, but it is hard to predict what the best timeout to use is, so a standard amount was chosen.

The code itself will verify using "assert" statements after each major step.  Most of these assertions verified that a proper page was displayed when a certain action was committed.  In addition, this test suite runs through all the test cases in numerical order, as every test cases is loosely related to the previous one and all require the user to be logged into the system.
